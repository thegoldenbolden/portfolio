      Bonjour, mes copines. my name is Jacob and I graduated from University of Memphis in 2020 with a bachelors in
      health science, but eventually decided to stay true to my younger self and pursue a career in{" "}
      <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other than coding, I spend most of my free time, <strong>rewatching</strong> Community and New Girl,{" "}
      <strong>playing</strong> video games and basketball, or <strong>learning</strong> French and Japanese.
     </p>
     <p>
      I&apos;m open to <strong>Job</strong> opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow. If you have a good
      opportunity that matches my skills and experience then don&apos;t hesitate to <strong>contact</strong> me. ðŸ˜€
     </p>
